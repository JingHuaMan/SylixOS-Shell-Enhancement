 * NOTIC:

 * you must use route_add() api add a 255.255.255.255 (broadcast host) route,
 * so udp broadcast packet can transmit on aodv netif.
 *
 * If you have more than two netif: 
 * that nodes in a aodv subnet required access to the external networks, this node can be a gateway.
 * first add a external netif like eth-net interface, and set it to default netif.
 * then add aodv netif, and use route_add() api add a 255.255.255.255 (broadcast host) route to aodv netif
 * then call aodv_gw_set(1) to be a aodv gateway.
 *
 * If you use aodv NOT in SylixOS, you MUST use netif_set_default() set aodv netif as a default netif.
