/**
 * struct emuframe - The 'emulation' frame structure
 * @emul:	The instruction to 'emulate'.
 * @badinst:	A break instruction to cause a return to the kernel.
 *
 * This structure defines the frames placed within the delay slot emulation
 * page in response to a call to mips_dsemul(). Each thread may be allocated
 * only one frame at any given time. The kernel stores within it the
 * instruction to be 'emulated' followed by a break instruction, then
 * executes the frame in user mode. The break causes a trap to the kernel
 * which leads to do_dsemulret() being called unless the instruction in
 * @emul causes a trap itself, is a branch, or a signal is delivered to
 * the thread. In these cases the allocated frame will either be reused by
 * a subsequent delay slot 'emulation', or be freed during signal delivery or
 * upon thread exit.
 *
 * This approach is used because:
 *
 * - Actually emulating all instructions isn't feasible. We would need to
 *   be able to handle instructions from all revisions of the MIPS ISA,
 *   all ASEs & all vendor instruction set extensions. This would be a
 *   whole lot of work & continual maintenance burden as new instructions
 *   are introduced, and in the case of some vendor extensions may not
 *   even be possible. Thus we need to take the approach of actually
 *   executing the instruction.
 *
 * - We must execute the instruction within user context. If we were to
 *   execute the instruction in kernel mode then it would have access to
 *   kernel resources without very careful checks, leaving us with a
 *   high potential for security or stability issues to arise.
 *
 * - We used to place the frame on the users stack, but this requires
 *   that the stack be executable. This is bad for security so the
 *   per-process page is now used instead.
 *
 * - The instruction in @emul may be something entirely invalid for a
 *   delay slot. The user may (intentionally or otherwise) place a branch
 *   in a delay slot, or a kernel mode instruction, or something else
 *   which generates an exception. Thus we can't rely upon the break in
 *   @badinst always being hit. For this reason we track the index of the
 *   frame allocated to each thread, allowing us to clean it up at later
 *   points such as signal delivery or thread exit.
 *
 * - The user may generate a fake struct emuframe if they wish, invoking
 *   the BRK_MEMU break instruction themselves. We must therefore not
 *   trust that BRK_MEMU means there's actually a valid frame allocated
 *   to the thread, and must not allow the user to do anything they
 *   couldn't already.
